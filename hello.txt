Hi!

This is my file!
It contains some text that I wrote.
This is some text that will be committed from branch two
This is some more text,
this written on branch three.


This will be committed, and will become the detached head.
Playing with the detached head (forgive me).

I'm just continuing to mess with the same file because it seems more likely to cause conflict.
And conflict is the spice of life.
